## Usage

This repo is consumed as a git submodule at `kvlang-design/` inside the main [kvlang](https://github.com/array2d/kvlang) repo:

```bash
git submodule update --init kvlang-design
```

## Design tree

Design specs form a tree rooted at `DESIGN.md`.
Every package implementation must conform to all ancestor specs on its path.
See `.claude/claude.md` for the full rule set.
